# UniChat

UniChat is a study collaboration platform for University students. It's focus will initially be on UCalgary Engineering courses.

This is being developed as a passion project to enhance the experience of students using UCalgary's Engineering Academic Success Centre (EASC), which (pre-Covid) was a physical workspace with upper-year engineering students offering tutoring services for first- and second-year engineering courses. Since Covid, the space has become virtual, taking place on Zoom. The aim of UniChat is to create a digital EASC that enables students and tutors to connect more conveniently and efficiently.

The backend of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/shadeemerhi/unichat-api).
